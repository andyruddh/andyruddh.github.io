Our prior LfD-STL framework was only applicable to discrete spaces. In this paper, we extend the framework to continuous spaces and stochastic environment and discuss how our framework performs in realistic environments.

This paper was published in IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters (RA-L) and was presented at the 2021 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS).
