The link to my latest work on neuro-symbolic apprenticeship learning is below. It implements temporal logic-guided reinforcement learning from demonstrations in a variety of mobile navigation, fixed-base manipulation and mobile-manipulation tasks using the **Nvidia Isaac** simulator. This paper has now been accepted at [IROS 2024](https://iros2024-abudhabi.org/), and will be presented in Abu Dhabi this October.
