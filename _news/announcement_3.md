I am proud to say that our work presented at CoRL 2020 on robot learning-from-demonstrations using temporal logics was featured in many of the major Computer Science news platforms: [The RISKS Digest](http://catless.ncl.ac.uk/Risks/32.39#subj10) (run by [Peter G. Neumann](http://www.csl.sri.com/users/neumann/) of SRI International), [ACM TechNews](https://technews.acm.org/archives.cfm?fo=2020-11-nov/nov-25-2020.html), [USC News](https://viterbischool.usc.edu/news/2020/11/showing-robots-how-to-drive-a-carin-just-a-few-easy-lessons/), [USC Viterbi News](https://viterbischool.usc.edu/news/2020/12/conference-on-robotic-learning-teaching-robots-to-cook-navigate-and-learn-from-mistakes/) and others.
