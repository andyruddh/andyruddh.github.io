I am a Computer Science PhD candidate at USC, where I am a member of the [ICAROS](http://icaros.usc.edu) and [CPS-VIDA](https://cps-vida.github.io) labs. My research interests include:
  - language-guided (formal specifications) safe human-robot interactions
  - robot learning from demonstrations/imitation learning
  - (deep) reinforcement learning
  - formal verification of autonomous cyber-physical systems
  - explainable AI for apprenticeship learning

I was a research intern during Summer 2022 at [SRI International](https://www.sri.com/)'s Center for Vision Technologies (CVT), working on lifelong learning. Prior to joining the PhD program, I was a Researcher in the Intelligent Connected Systems (ICS) Division at Toyota North America - InfoTech Labs (formerly, Toyota InfoTechnology Center) where I worked on data-driven formal specification for connected vehicle applications using edge computing.

I graduated with a masters in Computer Science (Intelligent Robotics specialization) from USC in 2018 and received my bachelors from B.M.S College of Engineering, India in 2016.

## music

I am also an electronic music producer under the alias [Andy-Ruddh](https://soundcloud.com/andyruddh) and my sounds consist of raw and hypnotic techno. My music has been supported by **Richie Hawtin**, a pioneer of this genre. My label-debut EP reached its highest ranking of **#31** on the Beatport Global Techno charts in February 2023.
