I am a Postdoctoral Associate in the [Institute for Systems Research (ISR)](https://isr.umd.edu) at the [University of Maryland - College Park](https://umd.edu), working under the mentorship of Prof. [John S. Baras](https://johnbaras.com) and Prof. [Calin Belta](https://calinbelta.com).

The theme of my research is _Neuro-Symbolic AI for safe autonomy_, which includes topics such as:

- robot learning from demonstrations/imitation learning
- deep reinforcement learning
- formal verification of autonomous cyber-physical systems
- explainable AI for human-robot interactions

I received my Ph.D. in Computer Science at the [University of Southern California (USC)](https://usc.edu) in 2024. Previously, I received the M.S. degree in Computer Science (Intelligent Robotics specialization) from USC in 2018, and my B.E. in Computer Science and Engineering from Visvesvaraya Technological University (VTU) - [B.M.S College of Engineering](https://bmsce.ac.in), India in 2016.

I was a research intern during Summer 2022 at [SRI International](https://www.sri.com/)'s Center for Vision Technologies (CVT), working on lifelong learning. Prior to joining the Ph.D. program, I was a Researcher in the Intelligent Connected Systems (ICS) Division at [Toyota North America - InfoTech Labs](https://amrd.toyota.com/division/itl/) (formerly, Toyota InfoTechnology Center) where I worked on data-driven formal specification for connected vehicle applications using edge computing.
